Programming To Do :

- Add index bindings.
- Further homoginize the C stubs.
- Tree entries should produces a blob directly, not just it's id.
- Implement lazy lists for tree entries, commit parents, indexes, etc.
- Is a union database object wise?  Any other stuff that should be more MLish?
- Add bindings to creating and manipulating the varios data structures when
  not managed by a repository.
- Add write bindings for the objects managed in the repository, indices, etc.
- Add revision walker bindings.
- Figure out why libgit2 lacks merging.  :(

Build To Do :

- Fix the build for interactive mode.
- Find out how one breaks up OCaml module into seperate files.  Worse case
  senario, nuweb will even let you mix the C stubs and OCaml.
