Programming To Do :

- Expand the test.ml to cover creating, modifying, and writing database
  objects and the index.
- Update the memory managment stuff for the development branch of libgit2.
- Handle union database objects better.  Functors seems like overkill though.
- Add revision walker bindings.
- Figure out why libgit2 lacks merging.  :(

Build To Do :

- Fix the build for interactive mode.
- Find out how one breaks up OCaml module into seperate files.  Worse case
  senario, nuweb will even let you mix the C stubs and OCaml.
